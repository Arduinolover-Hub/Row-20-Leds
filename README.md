# Row-20-Leds
This is a very practical board that I always use, it has different purposes for example: Fast board to test our codes, board output checker and led sequence maker. The board is compatible with Arduino (any arduino board), but you can use it with a breadboard and in this way also able to work with the microcontroller that you prefer or you are familiar with. We are going to build it from scratch to the pcb. From idea to desing.

# MAIN FEAUTURES
- In total 20 digital outpus, which means 20 diodes led, ready to use.
- Common components, very easy to find in our local electronic store.
* Contains a row of male header for the practical conection.
Compatible with all Arduino board (The same pinout)
Possible to use in a breadboard and work with other microcontrollers.
Save a lot of time for making the conections the board is ready.
Very practical to see the function of your codes.
